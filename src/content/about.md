Hey there, I’m a self taught full-stack developer.

I originally started out building sites in WordPress, but over the years I’ve continued to develop my skills in both backend and frontend frameworks.

I work full-time for an agency that mostly produces websites in WordPress, but luckily my role at the company entrusts me to determine what the best direction is for the task at hand. If that means stepping outside of the company norm and using more modern stacks, then I’m given free reign to do so.

It’s great, I’m able to upskill myself in and out of work, keeping up with the latest tech stacks and avoiding stagnation. Even the WordPress stack we use is not ordinary, it uses Vite. This allows the team and I to be with the code rather than how WordPress is usually used nowadays.

From a development skills perspective, I’m not only good at figuring out the technicalities and understanding what needs to be done; but I’m also really great at design work and styling too. I usually write all the styling myself and hardly rely on design systems like Tailwind.

On a personal level I’m a highly motivated and ambitious individual. I always strive to be the best I can be at anything and everything that I do. It’s hardwired into me to keep going and learn from the issues.
